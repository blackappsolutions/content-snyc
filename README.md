<a name="overview"></a>Overview
--------
[Core Content Jobs](https://github.com/blackappsolutions/core-content-jobs) is a extensible framework provided by [Black App Solutions](https://black-app-solutions.de/). It introduces a new DocType "ContentJob" and uses the [Preview-CAE](https://digital.vfc.com/stash/projects/VEC/repos/coremedia-application/browse/apps/cae/spring-boot/cae-preview-app?at=refs%2Fheads%2Fdevelop) as a runtime environment due to the limitations of CMCC-S. It comes pre-packaged with the following Jobs:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

But you can also develop new jobs very easy:

1.  Create a new class in modules/extensions/blackapp-core-content-jobs/core-content-jobs-cae/src/main/java/de/bas/content/jobs
2.  The class must extend de.bas.content.jobs.AbstractContentJob and should provide the following annotations

@Slf4j
@Scope("prototype")
@Component("rssImport")
public class ImportRSSJob extends AbstractContentJob {

\=> After deplyoment, this class will be usable with the name **rssImport** in **localSettings.job-type** of ContentJob-resources in CMS.  
  

**ContentJobs can be scheduled.**

There is also a [Freemarker-Template](https://github.com/blackappsolutions/core-content-jobs/blob/main/core-content-jobs-cae/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/WEB-INF/templates/content-jobs/com.coremedia.blueprint.common.contentbeans/CMPlaceholder.%5Bcontent-jobs%5D.ftl) available to maintain long-running/scheduled jobs.

If you want to use the task overview page to cancel scheduled job, create

*   a new Placeholder-ViewType `content-sync-jobs` and
*   a Placeholder-Resource that has this ViewType set.
*   Set the Placeholder-Resource in an Article or Page OR
*   issue `/blueprint/servlet/dynamic/content-jobs/terminate/1234` directly.

rssImport
---------

Serves only as a blueprint/template for new jobs and wants to show, that you can use this framwork also to do content imports. See source code for details => [https://github.com/blackappsolutions/core-content-jobs/blob/main/core-content-jobs-cae/src/main/java/de/bas/content/jobs/ImportRSSJob.java](https://github.com/blackappsolutions/core-content-jobs/blob/main/core-content-jobs-cae/src/main/java/de/bas/content/jobs/ImportRSSJob.java)

*   Imports RSS from locaSettings.rss-import-url if specified. Otherwise uses "https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Technology.xml" as default.
*   If you supply another RSS-feed, its structure must match the one in the default-feed above.
*   [Supply a folder](#id-09.CoreContentJobs-defineFolder) in **The folder/content which schould be synced**
*   RSS-Item->title-Attribute is mapped to CMArticle→title
*   RSS-Item->description-Attribute is mapped to CMArticle→detailText
*   For every RSS-Item an Article is created in the folder provided above [after the job was started](#id-09.CoreContentJobs-startJob).
*   Articles were name with this pattern:
    
    RssImport\_" \+ System.currentTimeMillis()
    

xmlExport
---------

This Job makes use of [CoreMedia's ServerExport Tool](https://documentation.coremedia.com/cmcc-10/artifacts/2010/webhelp/contentserver-en/content/CMServerimportExport.html#d0e17572) by [taking the given content, recursive and the zip-url](https://github.com/blackappsolutions/core-content-jobs/blob/313dda3a416a548facd8605ab988edbe44bf3530/core-content-jobs-cae/src/main/java/de/bas/content/jobs/ExportXMLJob.java#L48). See below how this instrumentation is made in the CMS.

*   go to "/All Content/Settings/Options/Settings/Content Jobs" at [https://studio.first.sandbox.vfc.coremedia.cloud/](https://studio.first.sandbox.vfc.coremedia.cloud/) for example
*   Create a new content item of type "ContentJob"
*   set the **Job type** to "xmlExport"
*   Add content you would like to export by using drag&drop to **The folder/content which schould be synced**

**![](attachments/114566139/114566172.png)**

*   To add a folder, navigate into it and add a new content item of type "Folder Properties"
*   Make the name of this content item reflect the folder name.

![](attachments/114566139/114566145.png)

*   Also drag&drop the new content item of type "Folder Properties" to **The folder/content which schould be synced** (see above)
*   Set the **Storage-URL** to "s3://vf-cm-qa-nora-coremedia-cms-migration-v2/"
*   **Note**: You can check **Sync Recursive**, if you have provided content item(s) of type "Folder Properties" to **The folder/content which schould be synced** and sync this folder with all of its subfolders.
*   To start the job, you just need to check **active** and push the **Finish editing and apply all changes button**

**![](attachments/114566139/114566158.png)**

*   When the job is done,
    *   you find a new version of this ContentJob created by user **content-jobs-user**  
        **![](attachments/114566139/114566160.png)**
    *   The **active** flag will be unchecked by **content-jobs-user**
    *   If the job was successful, you find a "1" at **Last run / Last run was successful?** otherweise a "0"
    *   When things went fine, you find a protocol at **Last run / Execution protocol** and you can find your content as a zip (s3://vf-cm-qa-nora-coremedia-cms-migration-v2/203594.zip) at [https://vf-cm-qa-nora-coremedia-cms-migration-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html](https://vf-cm-qa-nora-coremedia-cms-migration-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)

![](attachments/114566139/114566173.png)

When things went south, check the logs of cae-preview at Kibana or on Sandboxes you can see them directly under

[https://first.sandbox.vfc.coremedia.cloud/cae-preview/logfile](https://first.sandbox.vfc.coremedia.cloud/cae-preview/logfile)

[https://second.sandbox.vfc.coremedia.cloud/cae-preview/logfile](https://second.sandbox.vfc.coremedia.cloud/cae-preview/logfile)

xmlImport
---------

This Job makes use of [CoreMedia's ServerImport Tool](https://documentation.coremedia.com/cmcc-10/artifacts/2010/webhelp/contentserver-en/content/CMServerimportExport.html#cm:serverimport) by [taking the recursive flag and the zip-url](https://github.com/blackappsolutions/core-content-jobs/blob/313dda3a416a548facd8605ab988edbe44bf3530/core-content-jobs-cae/src/main/java/de/bas/content/jobs/ImportXMLJob.java#L26) and the following defaults:

![](attachments/114566139/114566263.png)

We can change that behaviour later, when we find out that other defaults may suit better or when we should give users the power to supply that parameters.

So - for example - we could set "halt on error" to false, because of the following scenario:

*   In Import-Zip is a Page with a Link to a Settings-Document located in another folder
*   This Settings-Document was not part of the export
*   Result: Import will do its job until it hits this error. All resources due to this point will be left in state checked-out by user content-jobs-user.

See below how this instrumentation is made in the CMS.

*   Go to "/All Content/Settings/Options/Settings/Content Jobs" at - for example - [https://studio.fourth.sandbox.vfc.coremedia.cloud/](https://studio.fourth.sandbox.vfc.coremedia.cloud/)
*   Create a new ContentJob
*   Set **Job type** to xmlImport
*   Check **Sync recursive**
*   Set **Storage-URL** to s3://vf-cm-qa-nora-coremedia-cms-migration-v2/203594.zip
*   Check **active** and push the **Finish editing and apply all changes button**
